            I am a budding developer. My interest in Web Development was something that came with being 
            interested in Computer Science. However, Web Development became an actual professional goal of mine 
            over the summer break when I decided to create a Web Development project with the help of articles 
            and videos on the internet. I enjoyed the experience a lot, and now, along with Cybersecurity, Web 
            Development is a career path I am determined to take.
